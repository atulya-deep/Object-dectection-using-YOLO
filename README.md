# Object-dectection-using-YOLO
OLO is an acronym that stands for You Only Look Once. We are employing Version 5, which was launched by Ultralytics in June 2020 and is now the most advanced object identification algorithm available. It is a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects objects in real-time with great accuracy. This approach uses a single neural network to process the entire picture, then separates it into parts and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each component. These bounding boxes are weighted by the expected probability. The method “just looks once” at the image in the sense that it makes predictions after only one forward propagation run through the neural network. It then delivers detected items after non-max suppression (which ensures that the object detection algorithm only identifies each object once)
